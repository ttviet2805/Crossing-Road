## Project Description
The game is coded in C++17 using the multimedia library [SFML 2.5.1](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php).

In this game, our character loves his crush. However, she does not like him, so he would like to collect 7 dragon balls to have a wish that his crush will love him. This is extremely challenging to him because he needs to overcome 7 levels to collect enough dragon balls (each level has 1 dragon ball)

He cannot fly, so he need to walk to cross the road in each level to collect dragon ball. In each level, there are some obstacles which can kill him or hinder him from coming to the goal such as vehicles, rocks or animals.

Fortunately, in the process of crossing roads, he can get some items which can increase his life or his speed
* Heart: to increase character's life
* Wing: to increase character's speed

Character needs user's helps to safety cross the roads of each level to collect enough dragon balls to let his crush love him.

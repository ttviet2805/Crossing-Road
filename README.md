## Project Description
The game was developed in **C++17** using the multimedia library [**SFML 2.5.1**](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php).

In this game, the **protagonist** embarks on a heartfelt quest to collect **seven Dragon Balls** in order to fulfill a wish that his crush will return his love. This journey is divided into **seven progressively challenging levels**, each containing one Dragon Ball that must be obtained to complete the quest.

Since the protagonist cannot fly, he must **cross multiple roads on foot** in each level to reach the goal. Along the way, he encounters various **obstacles**—such as vehicles, rocks, and animals—that may hinder his progress or cause him to lose a life.

To assist him, the game introduces collectible **power-up items** that temporarily enhance his abilities:

* **Heart** — Increases the character’s life.  
* **Wing** — Increases the character’s movement speed.  

The **player’s objective** is to guide the character safely across all levels, overcoming obstacles and collecting all seven Dragon Balls to help him fulfill his ultimate wish for love.
